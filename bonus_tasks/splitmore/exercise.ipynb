    "You are working in a young start-up called SplitmORe that is currently developing an application that facilitates money transfer between people. Now, the application is about to go to the beta-phase and you are tasked to develop an optimization algorithm that determines possible cash flows that will be later suggested to the users of the app. In the app, there are so called groups g \\in Gg∈G that consist of different subsets P_g \\subseteq PP \n",

    "  (that may include themselves). This procedure now leaves every person in a group with an accumulated balance, where positive balances stand for receivables and negative balances for liabilities. Once a user enters a payment, the accumulated positive and negative adjustments to users' balances of the respective group are always equally high and thus, the sum of balances within a group of users is always equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is possible that people are in several groups and therefore have several balances that sum up to a single net balance. Therefore, this net balance determines the overall amount of money a user will have to pay to (several) other users or that they might receive from such. To make the process efficient, you decided with your team that the application calculates suggested cash flows based upon those net balances b_pb \n",
