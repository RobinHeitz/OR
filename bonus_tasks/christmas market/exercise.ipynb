    "After you have more or less passed your first class test, you would like to go to the Christmas market with your fellow students and drink some hot wine. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be an easy endeavour for such a large group, because a few conditions have to hold for each person p \\inp∈ people and each hot wine stand s \\ins∈ stands:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every person pp has an individual budget budget[p] for the evening that they do not want to exceed.\n",
    "Students have their individual preferences regarding the hot wine stands and where they want to spend their evening, so each person pp wants to drink a maximum of max_wine_per_stand[p,s] cups of hot wine at stand s \\ins∈ stands.\n",
    "Every person needs at least min_wine_total[p] cups of hot wine to enjoy the evening. The person should drink at least that much to have fun.\n",
    "It is cold and to ensure that no one is freezing, every person needs an average drinking temperature of min_avg_temperature. For a given liquid volume V=\\sum_i V_iV=∑ \n",

    "To ensure that no one is waiting too long without a drink at a stand ss, every person pp can only drink one cup more or less than any other person at the same stand.\n",
    "Since RWTH tests different hot wine stands every year, the data sets are already given. For every s \\ins∈stands we already know:\n",
    "\n",
    "temperature[s]: The temperature of the hot wine in degrees Celsius\n",
    "amount[s]: The amount of hot wine per cup in milliliter\n",

    "You are given the files christmas_market.py, christmas_market-2018.py and christmas_market-2019.py. Complete the code in christmas_market.py to find an optimal solution to the hot wine problem that meets the given conditions.\n",

    "Model the problem as an integer linear program and add the missing constraint to the file christmas_market.py so that the hot wine problem is solved. If necessary, add attributes for the given decision variables (e.g. lb, ub, obj, vtype) in the given model. You can (partially) test your model by executing the code in christmas_market-2018.py or christmas_market-2019.py. The solve() function you completed will be called from christmas_market.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add comments at the places where you complete christmas_market.py, specifying what the corresponding lines mean. This increases the understanding of your model in case of wrong evaluations and makes it easier for you to keep track of more complicated models.\n",

    "The data sets for hot wine are all real data sets. So feel free to play around with them and model your own problems, like a traveling sales person problem (TSP).\n",

    "The files christmas_market-2018.py and christmas_market-2019.py shall not be modified, only add to the file christmas_market.py.\n",
    "In order to test your model, the files christmas_market-2018.py and christmas_market-2019.py have to be saved in the same directory as the file christmas_market.py.\n",
    "First write down the model on paper, and implement it if you are certain that it is correct.\n",
    "Please keep in mind to create a linear model. If you multiply different variables with each other, this will result in 0 points.\n",
    "The optimal objective value is 81.481.4 for christmas_market-2018.py and 102102 for christmas_market-2019.py.\n",
    "You can add additional variables, but the given variables have to be used and must not be renamed, otherwise you will receive 0 points.\n",
    "Please keep in mind that the problem has to be modeled correctly. It is not enough if your model just returns the correct objective values for the test instances.\n",
    "If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask in the forum or on the internet. Good luck!\n",
