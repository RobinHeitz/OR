    "You are working together with a city planner to optimize an emergency network for a larger city. For that, a data science team has clustered the city into a set of emergency locations LL (henceforth called locations only). Each location j \\in Lj∈L needs to be served by at least one hospital. Hospitals can be built in any of the locations. The tasks consists in deciding in which locations to open hospitals and where to deploy ambulances and helicopters to minimize the maximum reaction time to any other location. Both ambulances and helicopters form the set of methods of transport T=\\{T={'amb','hel'\\}}.\n",
